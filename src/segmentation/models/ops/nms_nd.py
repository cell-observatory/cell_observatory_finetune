    Performs non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the boxes according
    to their intersection-over-union (IoU).

    NMS iteratively removes lower scoring boxes which have an
    IoU greater than iou_threshold with another (higher scoring)
    box.

    Args:
        dets : Tensor[N, 4+1] for 2D or Tensor[N, 6+1] for 3D.
            boxes to perform NMS on. They
            are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2, score) or
            (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, score) format
        iou_threshold : float
            discards all overlapping
            boxes with IoU < iou_threshold

    Returns:
    keep : Tensor
        int64 tensor with the indices
        of the elements that have been kept
        by NMS, sorted in decreasing order of scores
