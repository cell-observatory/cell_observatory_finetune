    ONNX spec requires the k-value to be less than or equal to the number of inputs along
    provided dim. Certain models use the number of elements along a particular axis instead of K
    if K exceeds the number of elements along that axis. Previously, python's min() function was
    used to determine whether to use the provided k-value or the specified dim axis value.

    However, in cases where the model is being exported in tracing mode, python min() is
    static causing the model to be traced incorrectly and eventually fail at the topk node.
    In order to avoid this situation, in tracing mode, torch.min() is used instead.

        input (Tensor): The original input tensor.
