    Performs non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the boxes according
    to their intersection-over-union (IoU).

    NMS iteratively removes lower scoring boxes which have an
    IoU greater than iou_threshold with another (higher scoring)
    box.

        dets : Tensor[N, 4+1] for 2D or Tensor[N, 6+1] for 3D.
            boxes to perform NMS on. They
